#### The Goals
* Build a Chrome extension
* Base the extension on React

#### Instructions
* `git clone https://github.com/ohaddahan/how-to-build-react-chrome-extension`
* `cd how-to-build-react-chrome-extension`
* `./scripts/run.sh`
* Load the unpacked extension into Chrome

#### The details
`./scripts/run.sh` is a fairly simple shell script to follow , here is how it works:
* Setup and use `nvm` , this part optional , and you comment this section if you like.
I left it since I think it's easier to avoid version mismatches with `nvm`
* Create the React application by running `npx create-react-app ${extName} --use-npm` where `extName` is an environment variable with default value `react-chrome-extension`.
* Install dependencies `npm install npm-run-all webpack-cli axios @material-ui/core chalk`.
* Copy `contentScript.js` and `background.js` sample files from my repo into the new extension `src` directory.
* Copy over the `scripts` and `icons`.
* Run `node scripts/prep.js` (will elaborate on it later).
* Finally it will build our extension using `npm run build`

## Why all these extra scripts?
Let me elaborate on the various issues I encountered while getting this to work.

* `package.json` compatibility issues:
  * Changes done to `pacakge.json` by `./scripts/prep.js`:
  ```javascript
  packageJSON['scripts']  = {
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject",
     "test":  "react-scripts test",
     "prebuild": "rm -fr build ; node scripts/validate.js",
     "build": "npm-run-all build:*",
     "build:app": "INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false react-scripts build",
     "build:files":  "node ./scripts/build.js",
     "prezip": "rm -fr *.zip",
     "zip": "npm-run-all zip:*",
     "zip:build": "cd build; zip -r ../build.zip * -x '*.DS_Store'",
     "zip:src": "zip -r src.zip src package.json README.md public -x '*.DS_Store'",
     "release": "npm-run-all build zip"
   };
   packageJSON['eslintConfig']  = { "extends": "react-app" };
  ```
  
  There were no changes done to `start` , `eject` and `test`.  
  `prezip` , `zip` , `zip:build` , `zip:src` and `release` are just regular helpers needed for any Chrome extension.                                                                                                 

  * `prebuild` first cleans up the previous build and then runs `./scripts/validate.js` 
  all this script does is check that `package.json` and `manifiest.json` are valid `JSON` files and that the required
  Chrome settings exist.
  (some of the settings I used aren't really mandatory but are a very common case and you can remove them if you have such a special case
  `icons` and `browser_action`)
  
  * The use of `npm-run-all` is purely for ease of use to run multiple targets from one target.

  * Since we're using `create-react-app` it will use `react-scripts build` which doesn't expect to be used
  as an extension. The first thing we need to change is adding `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false` before `react-scripts build`.
  This is done inside `package.json` , under `scripts` key , you can see the result in the final file create by `scripts/run.sh`.
  If we won't use this flag Chrome will not run React properly and raise a
  Content Security Policy error since React will try to inline JavaScript code.

    * `package.json` at  `scripts` key , `"build:app": "INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false react-scripts build"`

    * [Create React App - Advanced Configuration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration)
    > By default, Create React App will embed the runtime script into index.html during the production build.
      When set to false, the script will not be embedded and will be imported as usual.
      This is normally required when dealing with CSP.

    * [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy)
    > Inline JavaScript will not be executed.
      This restriction bans both inline `<script>` blocks and inline event handlers (e.g. `<button onclick="...">`).
      The first restriction wipes out a huge class of cross-site scripting attacks by making it impossible for you to
      accidentally execute script provided by a malicious third-party.
      It does, however, require you to write your code with a clean separation between content and behavior 
      (which you should of course do anyway, right?). An example might make this clearer.
      You might try to write a Browser Action's popup as a single popup.html containing


  * `script/build.js` is the last helper script we have, it simply runs `npx webpack` on the `contentScript.js` 
  and `background.js` , after that it copies them into the build directory since `react-scripts` won't do it for us.

  
* `manifest.json` compatibility issues:

  * We add `version` and `manifest_version` which `create-react-app` doesn't add but Chrome demands.
  We also add `icons` which isn't mandatory but comes as an incompatible format from `create-react-app`.
  
  * We remove `background_color`, `display`, `start_url` and  `theme_color` which come from `create-react-app` but 
  aren't compatible with Chrome.
  
  * We also add `browser_action` , `content_scripts` , `permissions` , `content_security_policy` , `background`
   which aren't mandatory but most likely needed by most and is missing.
  
#### Background and Content Scripts
Included are simple `background.js` and `contentScript.js` which send a `GET` request to `https://postman-echo.com/get`.
The reason I included them is mainly for completeness and as a reference for others on how they work with a React-Chrome-Extension.
Furthermore they are also an example of `chrome.runtime` 

#### What does it actually do?
This sample extension will add a `div` and a `button` inside it , as seen in the image below.
Once you click on the button it will send  a `GET` request to `https://postman-echo.com/get` and print the response.

#### How to load and debug it?

![Load and background script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohaddahan/how-to-build-react-chrome-extension/master/images/image1.png)
![Chrome console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohaddahan/how-to-build-react-chrome-extension/master/images/image4.png)
![Background console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohaddahan/how-to-build-react-chrome-extension/master/images/image5.png)

1. Load the unpacked extension , make sure you're in developer mode and you select the `build` directory.

[Chrome - Getting Started Tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) and 

2. Enable background scripts , click on `background page (Inactive)` and it will turn to `background page`.
And open `DevTools` for the background scripts, without this you won't see any `console.log` or 
any other action done in the background

3. Inside your regular Chrome , open `DevTools` and you'll see the prints coming from `contentScript.js`.

4. The response from `https://postman-echo.com/get` inside `DevTools`.

5. The background `DevTools` as you can see by the title.

6. The prints from `background.js` and response from `https://postman-echo.com/get` inside `DevTools`.

#### Final thoughts
While trying to do this I was trying to follow a few other examples as shown in the references section.
Unfortunately none had all the elements I needed or explained all the details I elaborate on here.
I hope this will help anyone else who would like to create a React-Chrome-Extension.
(I'm sure my code can get better, open an issue on `GitHub` and I'll happily fix it)
